## Case Study: Blog

If you take any blog, the #1 enduser facing dynamic feature is the comment system.

[Disqus](https://disqus.com) is a comment system as a service.

On a technical level, disqus changed the way we think about comment implementation.

Now you have a choice: spend few days implementing a comment system or copy paste a piece of HTML/JS code on your web site to get an awesome, [fully featured](https://disqus.com/features) comment system in minutes with a great dashboard to visualise what happens in your community.

I'll let you guess which way most developpers will go if they want fast result. Disqus is everywhere now.

According to a study by Lijit, Disqus was used by 75% of websites in March 2011 who used a third-party commenting or discussion system.

Pretty much anything else in a blog can be static and regenerated every time you make a change in backoffice.
