## Case Study: Small to Medium size Eshop

Let's take a look at typical ecommerce shop.

What sections have to be updated in real time ?

In other words, what sections has to be dynamic ?

* shopping cart
* price / product quantity / sales
* payment processing
* "my orders" page
* "my addresses" page
* "track my order" page
* "customer support" form/page/chat

Pretty much any other customer facing feature or page can be static, and automaticaly regenerated every hour/day/week.
